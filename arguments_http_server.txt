pros:
- easy implementation (good for POC)
- makes 3rd party development easy (html & javascript)
- lewin: performance is better than talking directly to the server



cons:
- running the server all the time even when not needed
- security issue: data can be accessed through http requests by anyone -> need to at least build authorization -> currently used server engine does not have it?
-

alternatives:
- app extension (probably too simplistic)
- plugin architecture (selfmade or apache cordova?) 
  - CFPlugin (available for swift)
- https web server (https required starting 2017: https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/apple-will-require-https-connections-for-ios-apps-by-the-end-of-2016/)
